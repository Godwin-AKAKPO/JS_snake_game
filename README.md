    A classic Snake game implementation in JavaScript where players control a snake to eat apples and grow without hitting walls or itself.

    ## Project Overview

    This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the canvas, eating apples to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

    ## Game Components

    ### Snake

    The Snake is the main character controlled by the player:
    - Represented by a series of connected segments
    - Moves in four directions: up, down, left, right
    - Grows when it eats an apple
    - Dies upon collision with walls or itself

    ### Apple

    - Appears at random positions on the canvas
    - When eaten by the snake, causes the snake to grow and increases the score

    ### Game Board

    - Rectangular canvas where the game is played
    - Contains walls that are fatal to the snake upon collision

    ## How to Play

    1. Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction

    3. Avoid hitting walls or the snake's own body
    4. Try to achieve the highest score possible
